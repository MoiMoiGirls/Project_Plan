<h1>Hello, Welcome to our MoiMoiGirls' Oranization.</h1>
<p> We are HyeSoo and Ly:D <br/>We made this organization for sharing our ideas, building up Hoodie UI app 
    and improving our projects with nice opinions and feedbacks from wonderful peoples. (+Plus Happy coding) </p>

<h4>Now, we will introduce What is Hoodie, what is our project, our mentors and coaches and our project plans.</h4>

<h1>1.Introduction of Hoodie</h1>
    Hoodie is a framework.
   

<h1>2. Mentors</h1>  
   <p><strong>*Hoodie Mentors</strong> : Jan Lehnardt, Gregor </p>

<h1>3. Coaches</h1> 
   <p><strong>*Coahes</strong> : Esko Luontola<a href="https://twitter.com/orfjackal" target="_blank">(@orfjackal)</a>, Tobias<a href="https://twitter.com/tobiasbuehlmann" target="_blank">(@tobiasbuehlmann)</a>, Fernando Arriaga <a href="https://twitter.com/afarriaga" target="_blank"> (@afarriaga)</a>
    So far we communicated with coaches by Twitter, email and Facebook.  
    To communicate with our coaches, we will create common group pages.</p>
 
<h1>4. Related links with our project</h1> 
<ul>
<li>Project issue link : https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues/19</li>
<li>Project repository : In this Github Organization</li>
<li>Project Blog: http://moimoigirls.blogspot.fi/</li>
</ul>


<h1>5. The goal of our project</h1>
<ul>
<li>Creating a downloadable web app for Mac (and later Linux and Windows) </li>
      that manages Hoodie instead of writing command lines 
<li>Contributing our project to Open sources in GitHub </li>
</ul>

<h1>6.Why we choose these issues from the project?</h1>
<p>We like to create UI prototype to bring most enjoyable and convenient experiences to users.<br>
And both we are interested in particularly the front end part of the Web-development<br>
which can make interaction with users and finding the effective way to approach to user behavior.</p> 

<h1>7. Our project plan</h1>
<table>
    <tr><td> <h3>Preparation (From mid-April to June) </h3></td></tr>
    <tr><td> 1) Learning more about user interface models and philosophy (Materials from coach Esko) </td></tr>
    <tr><td> 2) Learning hoodie with reading documents and using command lines.</td></tr>
    <tr><td> 3) Learning programming language concepts and Javascript and more about HTML,CSS<br>
             (Online courses from CodeAcademy, code school, Coursera(from coach Fernando)</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>"3 Steps"(From July to September)</h3>
<table>
   <tr><td> "Step1": Making a user interface prototype (using HTML/CSS/JS) that manages Hoodie installation<br> 
	          and allows to create new apps, manage, existing apps and eventually deploy a live app.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>The sub-goal of step 1: Designing an easy approachable and user friendly interface</td></tr>
        <tr><td><How to approach regarding our skills:</li></ul>
                   *Our skills :  Photoshop, illustrator, HTML, CSS, (+Javascript after the preparation period) 
                   <ol><li> Brainstorming our idea about UI</li> 
                       <li> Choosing our best ideas</li>
		       <li> Focusing on designing the layout of UI</li>
		       <li> Implementing technical parts into the design</li>
		       <li> Testing our UI design and technical parts to get feedback (Upload our UI prototype
				    in the Hoodie Github and show our project to mentors and coaches, other  users)</li></ul></td></tr></table>  
 <table>
    <tr><td>"Step2":<ul><li> Figuring out what environments tool we can use, considering node-webkit, atom-shell so on.</li>
                    <li> Packaging up Hoodie with Node-webkit, so it can be launched from within the app with Node-webkit.</li></ul></td></tr>
     <tr><td>* How to approach<br>
              <ol><li>Figuring out which environments tool is best for the packaging up Hoodie</li>
		  <li>Asking mentors and coaches about our choices</li>
		  <li>Getting to know and how to use most suitable environment tool (such as ‘Node-webkit’ etc)</li>
	          <li>Packaging up Hoodie with Node-webkit</li></td></tr>
 </table>				  
 <table>
    <tr><td> "Step3": Making the front-end part of Hoodie run with PouchDB Server instead of CouchDB.</td></tr>
           <tr><td><ul><li> The sub-goal of step 3: Connecting the features of UI to Pouch DB to make Hoodie run with PouchDB</li>
                  <li> How to approach </li>
                      First, we will focus on connecting ‘creating new apps button (or link)’ to Pouch DB.<br>
                      After that, we will move on the connecting ‘managing existing apps button (or link)’ <br>
                      and eventually ‘deploying a live app button (or link)’ to Pouch DB.</td></tr>

<h1>8. Workplace </h1>
<p>We are planning to work on our project at our home, in coaches' office, in university/public libraries
 in beautiful beaches and misterious forests under the beautiful sunshine in Finland.</p>
