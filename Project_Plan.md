<h1>Hello, Welcome to our MoiMoiGirls GitHub Oranization.</h1>
<p> We are HyeSoo and Ly. We made this organization for sharing our ideas, building up Hoodie UI app 
    and improving our projects with nice opinions and feedbacks from wonderful peoples. (+Plus Happy coding) </p>

<h4>Now, we will introduce What is Hoodie, what is our project, our mentors and coaches and our project plans.</h4>


<h1>Introduction of “Hoodie”</h1> 
   <p> Hoodie is framework for frontend web applications that abstracts away the backend.  
    Simply, Hoodie is a noBackend technology! 
	
    Hoodie gives your frontend code superpowers/Dreamcode, 
    by allowing users to do things that only a backend can do.
    
    Hoodie’s vision and future goal is to be accessible for designers and
    people with few coding skills because Hoodie think this matters.
    Hoodie is written entirely in JavaScript.</p>

<h1>2. Mentors</h1>  
   <p><strong>*Hoodie Mentors</strong> : Jan Lehnardt, Gregor </p>

<h1>3. Coaches</h1> 
   <p><strong>*Coahes</strong> : Esko Luontola, Tobias Bühlmann, Fernando Arriaga
    So far we communicated with coaches by Twitter, email and Facebook.  
    To communicate with our coaches, we will create common group pages.</p>
 
<h1>4. Related links with our project</h1> 
<ul>
<li>Project issue link : https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues/19</li>
<li>Project repository : In this Github Organization</li>
<li>Project Blog: http://moimoigirls.blogspot.fi/</li>
</ul>


<h1>5. The goal of our project</h1>
<ul>
<li>Creating a downloadable web app for Mac (and later Linux and Windows) </li>
      that manages Hoodie instead of writing command lines 
<li>Contributing our project to Open sources in GitHub </li>
</ul>

<h1>6.Why we choose these issues from the project?</h1>
<p>We like to create UI prototype to bring most enjoyable and convenient experiences to users.
And both we are interested in particularly the front end part of the Web-development
which can make interaction with users and finding the effective way to approach to user behavior.</p> 

<h1>7. Our project plan</h1>
<table>
    <tr><td> <h3>Preparation (From mid-April to June) </h3></td></tr>
	<tr><td> Learning more about user interface models and philosophy (Materials from coach Esko) </td></tr>
    <tr><td> Learning hoodie with reading documents and using command lines.</td></tr>
    <tr><td> Learning programming language concepts and Javascript and more about HTML,CSS 
             (Online courses from CodeAcademy, code school, Coursera(from coach Fernando)</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
   <tr><td><h3>"3 Steps""(From July to September)</h3></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Step1: Making a user interface prototype (using HTML/CSS/JS) that manages Hoodie installation 
	          and allows to create new apps, manage, existing apps and eventually deploy a live app.</td></tr>
        <tr><td> <ul><li>The sub-goal of step 1: Designing an easy approachable and user friendly interface</li>
                <li> * How to approach regarding our skills:</li></ul>
                   ** Our skills :  Photoshop, illustrator, HTML, CSS, (+Javascript after the preparation period) 
                   ** Brainstorming our idea about UI -> Choosing our best ideas -> 
				    Focusing on designing the layout of UI -> Implementing technical parts into the design ->
					Testing our UI design and technical parts to get feedback (Upload our UI prototype 
					in the Hoodie Github and show our project to mentors and coaches, other  users)</td></tr></table>  
 <table>
    <tr><td> Step2: 1) Figuring out what environments tool we can use, considering node-webkit, atom-shell so on. 
                    2) Packaging up Hoodie with Node-webkit, so it can be launched from within the app with Node-webkit.</td></tr>
     <tr><td> * How to approach : 
                  Figuring out which environments tool is best for the packaging up Hoodie -> 
				  Asking mentors and coaches about our choice  -> Getting to know and 
				  how to use most suitable environment tool (such as ‘Node-webkit’ etc)
				  -> Packaging up Hoodie with Node-webkit </td></tr>
 </table>				  
 <table>
    <tr><td> Step3:  Making the front-end part of Hoodie run with PouchDB Server instead of CouchDB.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>* The sub-goal of step 3: Connecting the features of UI to Pouch DB to make Hoodie run with PouchDB
                   * How to approach : 
                      First, we will focus on connecting ‘creating new apps button (or link)’ to Pouch DB. 
                      After that, we will move on the connecting ‘managing existing apps button (or link)’ 
                      and eventually ‘deploying a live app button (or link)’ to Pouch DB.</td></tr>
 </table>

<h1>8. Workplace </h1>
<p>We are planning to work on our project at our home, in coaches' office, in university/public libraries
 in beautiful beaches and misterious forests under the beautiful sunshine in Finland.</p>
